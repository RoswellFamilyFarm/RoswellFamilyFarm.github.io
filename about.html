    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-6">
      Roswell Family Farm is lovingly run by Anthony and Emily Roswell, along with their three kids — Willow (6), Wayon (5), and Wyatt (3). Nestled in Salisbury, NY, our family is passionate about raising happy, healthy animals the natural way.

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-6">
      We specialize in <strong>pasture-raised chickens</strong> and have added <strong>ducks for both meat and eggs</strong>. Birds are raised outdoors on fresh pasture, with sunshine, greens, and room to roam — which makes for incredible flavor you can feel good about.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-6">
      Through our close partnership with <strong>Craig and Stephanie Spofford</strong> of <strong>Spofford Farm</strong>, we now offer <strong>roaster pigs</strong> and <strong>pasture-raised pork cuts</strong> (plus whole and half hogs). We’ve also expanded to include <strong>beef cuts</strong> so you can stock your freezer with local, high-quality meats from one trusted place.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
      Whether you’re enjoying chicken, duck, pork, or beef from Roswell Family Farm, you can trust it’s raised with care, transparency, and a whole lot of heart.

If you want the ages removed or the name spelled “Waylon” instead of “Wayon,” say the word and I’ll tweak it.

Got it 👍 You want a short plug-and-play section for your About page (or even flyers) that flows with your farm’s existing style but adds more storytelling and appeal — especially highlighting that your beef is locally sourced from trusted family farms.

Here’s a polished version you can drop right in:

<p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-6">
  In addition to our own poultry and pork, we’re proud to bring you <strong>locally sourced beef</strong> from nearby family farms who share our values. These farmers raise their cattle the way it should be done — on open pastures, with care, respect, and no shortcuts. By working together, we keep our beef close to home, support other hardworking families in our community, and deliver cuts that are rich in flavor, tenderness, and integrity. When you enjoy our beef, you’re not just savoring a great meal — you’re supporting a network of family farms dedicated to real food raised the right way.
</p>
Why this works:
Community connection → emphasizes local farms & supporting families.

Trust & values → stresses shared standards of care & respect.

Flavor promise → “rich in flavor, tenderness, and integrity” gives readers something to remember.

Call to emotion → eating becomes supporting a bigger mission.

👉 Do you want me to merge this into your full about.html code so you can copy-paste the updated file in one go?
