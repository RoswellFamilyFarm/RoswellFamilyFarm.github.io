    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-6">
      Roswell Family Farm is lovingly run by Anthony and Emily Roswell, along with their three kids — Willow (6), Wayon (5), and Wyatt (3). Nestled in Salisbury, NY, our family is passionate about raising healthy animals the right way, and sharing farm-fresh food with our community.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-6">
      We began with <strong>pasture-raised chickens</strong>, giving them room to roam, sunshine to soak in, and fresh grass and bugs to enjoy every day. This natural lifestyle makes for happier birds and richer flavor you can taste in every bite. We’ve since added <strong>ducks for both meat and eggs</strong>, bringing even more variety and farm-fresh goodness straight from our pastures to your plate.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-6">
      Through our close partnership with <strong>Craig and Stephanie Spofford</strong> of <strong>Spofford Farm</strong>, we’re proud to offer <strong>roaster pigs</strong>, whole and half hogs, and a wide variety of <strong>pasture-raised pork cuts</strong>. This partnership lets us bring you pork that’s tender, flavorful, and raised with the same values we live by here at Roswell Family Farm.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-6">
      For our <strong>beef</strong>, we source directly from trusted nearby family farms. These farms raise cattle on open pastures with the same standards of care, honesty, and respect that we believe in. By sourcing locally, we not only ensure the highest quality cuts but also support other hardworking families in our community. It’s food that strengthens the bonds of local farming while giving you meals that are rich, wholesome, and unforgettable.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-6">
      Our mission is simple: to provide <strong>affordable, high-quality meat to local families</strong>. By raising our own poultry and pork while sourcing beef and other products from neighboring farms, we’re able to expand the reach of all our markets. Someone might come looking for chicken and leave with pork or beef from another farm — and the same goes in reverse. It’s a win-win that strengthens local agriculture, keeps money in our community, and puts delicious, honest food on your table.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
      Whether it’s chicken, duck, pork, or beef, you can count on Roswell Family Farm to provide food that’s <strong>raised with love, rooted in tradition, and bursting with real flavor</strong>.
