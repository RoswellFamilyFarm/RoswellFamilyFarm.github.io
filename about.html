    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Welcome to Roswell Family Farm</h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-200 mb-4">
      Nestled in the heart of Salisbury, NY, Roswell Family Farm is a family-run homestead dedicated to raising animals the right way — on pasture, with care, intention, and plenty of fresh air.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-200 mb-4">
      The farm is led by Anthony and Emily Roswell, who are raising their three beautiful children — Willow (6), Wayon (5), and Wyatt (3) — to appreciate the land, animals, and values of real, honest food.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-200 mb-4">
      At the heart of their operation are their happy, healthy pasture-raised chickens — raised with no hormones or antibiotics, just sunshine, bugs, grass, and love. Soon, the Roswells will be introducing goats to their pasture rotation as well!
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-200 mb-4">
      Beyond their own animals, Anthony and Emily are proud to team up with close friends and fellow farmers Craig and Stephanie Spofford of <strong>Spofford Farm</strong>. This partnership brings you delicious, all-natural pork — pasture-raised with care, and available as whole hogs, half hogs, or (soon) a variety of convenient cuts.

      Roswell Family Farm is more than just a place to buy good meat — it’s a place rooted in family, stewardship, and a commitment to doing things the right way. From our family to yours, thank you for supporting local, pasture-raised food.
